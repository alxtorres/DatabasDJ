### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is known for its robustness, scalability, and compliance with SQL standards. It's widely used for various applications, from 
small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language): A standard language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. It's used for querying, updating, and managing relational database systems.
PostgreSQL: A specific RDBMS that uses SQL as its primary query language. It's a software implementation that supports SQL and provides additional features like complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views, transactional integrity, and multi-version concurrency control.


- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?

In psql, you can connect to a database using the command \c [database_name]. If you need to specify a user, host, or port, you can use the full command: psql -h [host] -p [port] -U [user] [database_name].

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?

WHERE Clause: Filters rows before grouping occurs in a SQL query. It's used to filter records before any groupings are made.

HAVING Clause: Filters groups after grouping occurs. It's used in combination with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results of a group.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?

INNER Join: Returns records that have matching values in both tables. It's the most common type of join.

OUTER Join: Returns all records when there is a match in one of the tables. It includes LEFT OUTER Join, RIGHT OUTER Join, and FULL OUTER Join.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?

LEFT OUTER Join: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.

RIGHT OUTER Join: Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the left side.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to work with data in terms of objects and classes, without having to write SQL queries. ORMs provide a bridge between an object-oriented language and a relational database, managing the conversion of data in both directions.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Allows web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server. It operates on the client side and can update the webpage without reloading it.

Server-Side (e.g., requests in Python): Involves making HTTP requests from the server. This is done entirely on the server side, often used for communicating between servers or fetching data before rendering a webpage.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated. A CSRF token is a secret, unique, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and transmitted to the client in such a way that it is included in a subsequent HTTP request made by the client. This token ensures that the server only accepts requests that have been explicitly authorized by the user, thus preventing CSRF attacks.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?

In web development, particularly in frameworks like Flask, form.hidden_tag() is used to include all hidden fields in one go. It's commonly used to add CSRF tokens to forms. By including this in a form, it helps in protecting the form against CSRF attacks by ensuring that the CSRF token is included in the form submission.
